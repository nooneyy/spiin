# Spiin

An ad-free aggregator for Coin Master rewards.

## Official site

Visit the official site of Spiin on [spiin.pages.dev](https://spiin.pages.dev)!

## Explanation

While the source code of the website itself is public, the API that the site fetches from is private. The API itself fetches its data from a database for mobile apps that provide CM rewards in exchange for ads. I didn't like this behavior, so I made this instead. If you for some reason wish to access this API, please contact me privately.
